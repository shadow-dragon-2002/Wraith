# Wraith

You're running an AI agent on your machine — Claude doing computer use, an AutoHotkey script, whatever — and you need to step away. The problem is that anyone who sits down at your desk can just grab the keyboard and mouse and start interfering. You don't want to close the AI session, you just want the physical inputs to go dead until you get back.

That's what Wraith does. Lock it from the system tray and the keyboard and mouse stop responding to physical input. The AI keeps typing, clicking, scrolling — it doesn't notice anything changed. Unlock it when you're back.

## How it actually works

Windows has a feature most people don't know about: every input event carries a flag that says whether it came from physical hardware or was injected by software. When you call `SendInput()`, press a key via AutoHotkey, or do anything through a remote session like Parsec or RDP, Windows sets `LLKHF_INJECTED` on the keyboard event (bit 4 of the flags field) and `LLMHF_INJECTED` on the mouse event (bit 0). Physical keystrokes and mouse movements don't have that flag set.

Wraith installs two low-level Windows hooks — `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` and `WH_MOUSE_LL` — that intercept every input event system-wide before it reaches any application. For each event, it checks one thing: is the injected flag set? If yes, pass it through. If no and we're locked, return 1 and swallow it.

That's the whole mechanism. No kernel driver, no virtual device, no registry tricks for the main blocking logic. The binary is around 50KB.

There's one thing you can't block from user mode: `Ctrl+Alt+Del`. Microsoft hardwired that into the kernel as the Secure Attention Sequence and no application can intercept it. Everything else is fair game.

## Remote access while locked

One thing worth knowing: input from Parsec, RDP, and VNC is also tagged as injected by Windows — those tools go through `SendInput` or equivalent. That means you can lock Wraith on the physical machine and still take control remotely from another device without touching the unlock hotkey. The physical desk is locked, the remote session works fine.

## Getting started

**Installer (recommended):** Grab `wraith-setup.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/shadow-dragon-2002/Wraith/releases) and run it. It handles everything.

**Portable:** Download `wraith.exe` and `wraith.ini` and put them in the same folder. Run it — Windows will ask for administrator access, which is required for the hooks to work reliably.

Once running, Wraith sits in the system tray. Right-click for the menu, double-click to toggle lock state.

## Controls

| What | Default |
|------|---------|
| Lock | `Ctrl + Shift + Alt + L` |
| Unlock | `Ctrl + Shift + Alt + U` |
| Panic unlock | Hold `Esc` for 3 seconds |
| Toggle | Double-click the tray icon |
| Menu | Right-click the tray icon |

The panic unlock is there as a last resort — if you forget your hotkey combo or something goes wrong, hold Escape for three seconds and it unlocks regardless.

## Configuration

All settings live in `wraith.ini` next to the `.exe`. Edit it in Notepad and restart Wraith to apply changes.

```ini
[Wraith]

; Modifier bitmask: MOD_ALT=1, MOD_CONTROL=2, MOD_SHIFT=4, MOD_WIN=8
; Ctrl+Shift+Alt = 2+4+1 = 7
LockModifiers=7
LockKey=76        ; 'L' — virtual key code

UnlockModifiers=7
UnlockKey=85      ; 'U' — virtual key code

PanicKey=27       ; Escape

LockOnStart=0     ; set to 1 to lock automatically when Wraith starts
```

The key codes are standard Windows virtual key codes: A-Z are 65-90, 0-9 are 48-57, function keys F1-F12 are 112-123. Full list at [learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes).

## Building from source

Wraith is written in Rust and cross-compiles from WSL to a Windows `.exe` via MinGW. You don't need a Windows machine to build it.

**One-time setup:**

```bash
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
sudo apt install -y gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64
```

**Build:**

```bash
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
# Output: target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release/wraith.exe
```

CI runs on GitHub Actions (Ubuntu + MinGW). Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag creates a release with the `.exe` and installer attached automatically.

If you want to embed custom icons, drop your `.ico` files into `assets/` and update `src/resource.rc` to reference them, then rebuild. The tray icon uses the 16x16 size; include at least 16x16 and 32x32 in the `.ico` file.

## Why not BlockInput?

`BlockInput()` is the obvious Windows API for this. The problem is it blocks everything — physical and synthetic alike. Your AI agent would also be locked out. Wraith specifically checks the injected flag so synthetic input passes through and only physical hardware gets blocked. As far as I can tell, no other open-source tool does this as a ready-made utility.
